# Egnyte Mapping Scripts
Utilizes PowerShell scripts to download and install the Egnyte desktop client and then map Egnyte drives based on group membership.

See the Wiki at https://github.com/chrysillis/egnyte/wiki for detailed information on how to deploy the scripts.

There are different steps depending on whether you want to deploy using Active Directory Group Policy or Microsoft's Intune.

These scripts will allow you to more easily lift and shift your on-premises infrastructure to the cloud.
